#A tender visitation of love to professors and profane, but especially to the inhabitants of the town of Waymouth. With some directions how they may try themselves, whether they are yet in their sins, or whether they are come to him that makes an end of sin. Also a warning to all sorts of people, that they may repent of the evil of their wayes whilest the day of mercy lasteth, least repentance be hid from their eyes. Howl ye inhabitants of the earth, for the day of vengeance is at hand, the Lord will stain the glory of all flesh. Being written from the breathings of life, by a hand-maid of the Lord, S. R.#
